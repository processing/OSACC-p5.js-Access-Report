### **Introduction**

The Education Guided Discussion began with a 5-minute introduction illustrating the agenda and the facilitators’ intent to approach this discussion unconference style, which is a participant-driven conference model that subverts the structure of traditional conferences by prioritizing participant voices to lead and govern an event. 

The introduction was followed by a 45-minute period for sub-topic discussions. The sub-topics were originally categorized under the four following areas: Course Design, Contribution, Teaching Modalities, and History and Culture. The participants proceeded to narrow down this list through a popular voting process, where they added a ‘plus’ sign next to the sub-topics they wished to discuss most within a shared document. The six final sub-topics chosen for the discussion were: 



* Teaching What it Means to Be a Contributor and How to Contribute to Open Source Projects
* Critiques of Dominant Technology
* Teaching Students with Different Technical Backgrounds + Teaching Code in a Creative Context: Art and Design Classes
* Teaching Hardware/Digital Fabrication in a Creative Context: Art and Design Classes
* Community Practices and Alternative Approaches to Technology
* Education as Job Training vs. Education as an End in Itself

Finally, the discussion ended with representatives from each group sharing what they’ve learned during the last 10 minutes. [This discussion was documented in a live notepad](http://docs.clinicopensourcearts.org/p/OSACC_Education_Discussions), which participants were encouraged to edit directly throughout the session.

### What It Means to Be a Contributor, and How to Contribute to Open Source Projects

An overarching question that directed this discussion was: How to make contributing to Open Source easier for people who want to get involved? 

To answer this, the group started to discuss why a contributor might hesitate to get involved and what the barriers to open-source contribution were. Some speculated or shared from personal experience that it was overwhelming to navigate Github’s interface, which makes it difficult to pinpoint suitable issues to take on or find necessary templates and documentation. They also found the contribution and testing process for a software’s graphical or front-end components to be confusing, because it often required finding designs, creating them if they didn’t exist yet, and working with different testing frameworks that varied depending on the project. Some also felt reluctant to contribute to code out of fear of making irrevocable changes.

The group also probed this issue from the maintainer’s perspective, where some of them shared that it required a sizable amount of dedicated effort and time to create accessible pathways and space for new contributors. Some of these efforts included pruning issues to a state where someone outside of the project could handle it and deciding when should the decision-making and resolving issues for a project be done by the community vs. the core team. 

With these initial issues established, the group started to discuss how they can make it easier for new contributors to get involved. One method was equipping people with the skill sets needed to contribute without needing to code (such as using Github as a collaborative tool), which is vital for those who are intimidated by contributing to other people’s work. Another was making it easier for someone to transition through different forms of software architecture for different projects by streamlining the flow of information and creating a smooth onboarding process. One way to do this might be having a contributor start by contributing to documentation or submitting a smaller change to help them adjust to the project's workflow. The group also explored different types of contributions (such as editing documentation, submitting examples, and creating media showcasing the work process) and how these different forms could be conveyed to new contributors. 

This led to a question of what qualifies an open source project and what responsibilities should be upheld with it. A member of the group stated that open source is technically about its licensing, and the idea of access is actually not inherent. However, that doesn't mean that a project’s community can’t make qualities such as thorough documentation and easier contribution important. 

Finally, the group ended the discussion with questions about commodification, and wondering if teaching ideology and ethics is also part of open source education. They emphasized instructing others to explicitly credit others for their work, so that they are “making visible the shoulders that your code is standing on as you learn”. Part of that process could be showcasing those who work on the project, their work, and recognizing and celebrating their contributions, no matter how small they might appear.

### Critiques of Dominant Technology

The first few questions this group decided to address in order to discuss this topic was: is this a critique of capitalism, and if so, what are the boundaries between it and technology? This appeared difficult to discern, but the group named some larger and trending technologies that are frequently intertwined with large corporations such as: AI, Blockchain, Cloud, and the mechanics of social media algorithms. The group also referenced Lev Manovich’s theories on new media in his book, [The Language of New Media](https://leonardo.info/book/the-language-of-new-media?gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwvilBhCFARIsADvYi7IBR7bx8Stc2x1AMQiJbHYVKkmN4EQgMv088o-R-HN9QFyaUPLV05oaAmnZEALw_wcB), which defines its distinct characteristics (like modularity, automation, variability, etc) and its silent pervasiveness in our everyday lives.  

The next important question to answer was: “who is technology happening to”, or who are the people that it affects? The group expanded on how it affects nearly all of us—the ubiquitous presence of dominant technologies defines our realities and shapes our behaviors, which is sustained by an almost natural inclination to turn to our current tools as solutions. They cited Bret Victor’s talk, “[The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4)”, which warns against falling into these patterns and assumptions by advising people to never assume knowledge, particularly towards computing and programming, in order to stay freely creative and engaged.

The group began to explore how to combat this by emphasizing the education of alternative histories, speculative design, and learning for knowledge over career skills. They felt it was important to create spaces for imagining what their futures and technologies could look like, and to empower and encourage others to learn how to build their own tools instead of relying on pre-existing ones to counter dominant technologies. Near the end of the discussion, everyone acknowledged their anxieties about the current status of dominant technology, and shared a few online and physical spaces that provided support: [SPFC](https://sfpc.study/), [EFF](https://www.eff.org/), book clubs, small communities of care, and the podcast “[This Machine Kills](https://www.patreon.com/thismachinekills)”.

### Teaching Students with Different Technical Backgrounds + Teaching Code in a Creative Context: Art and Design Classes

This discussion began with identifying the struggles and barriers to entry when teaching students coding in a creative context. Some educators voiced that they felt certain components of programming are not intuitive (i.e. class functions), and that it was difficult to support students who struggled with a subject that felt inherently unnatural for them. 

To workaround those issues, others suggested dividing students into smaller groups where those who have more technical knowledge are paired with others who have less experience, since sometimes students might have a better way of framing and conveying materials to each other than an educator would. 

Some also noted that they observed significant coding progress from their students when they were driven to accomplish a goal. For example, designers within their class appeared to be more interested in learning the application of programming and its functionalities, rather than its theory or fundamentals. With this in mind, they proposed that catering the curriculum to the students’ interests and changing the approach to equip students with basic fundamentals and aptitude to instruct themselves could be effective as well. Some examples of this that were discussed are: teaching an overview of programming basics without the lens of a specific language, providing examples tailored to the various goals of the students and showing them how to interpret it, and encouraging students to experiment and be comfortable with working without complete knowledge.

The discussion ended touching on the pros and cons of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), which is a block-based visual programming language and platform that’s popularly used as an educational tool to teach K-12 students programming. Some felt that Scratch can create an appreciation for structure, but might weigh down students who do not frequently plan to use programming for their projects. Identifying these issues led the group to return to the beginning of the discussion, where they reiterated how working at different paces for different groups of students could be challenging and how coding can be intimidating because of how new or obscure some of its terms or mathematical concepts could be.

### Teaching Hardware/Digital Fabrication in a Creative Context: Art and Design Classes

This discussion began with identifying the challenges of teaching hardware and digital fabrication, which mostly revolved around the complexity that’s added to:



* learning the code
* working with hardware and machine control
* acquiring the needed materials
* being aware of their ecological footprint
* the rise in overall costs once the students are brought into a physical fabrication context. 

Due to these intricacies and the need to teach multiple tools and languages, some voiced that it felt difficult to use teaching methods that are often employed when instructing one programming language. They also felt that being successful in this space often entailed strong, independent information retrieval skills, which could be difficult to develop or teach because oftentimes the relevant documentation is difficult to parse through. Although there could be better alternatives to the machines and hardware that are currently used, the group felt that they gravitate towards those platforms because they hold the most resources. For example, although Arduinos are slower and more expensive than other microcontrollers, it has many more resources and forms of support. The financial support from the school and department was identified as another pain point, since the students’ out of pocket costs for the tools and materials were partially contingent on how the department viewed the course (e.g. is this a core requirement or an elective).

With the challenges identified, the group decided to provide space for any questions they’d like to discuss before continuing with the discussion. Some questions and opportunities they shared were: 



* How do you scaffold the process between moving between a tutorial and open-ended production in this space? 
* How do you teach fabrication/hardware in an informal learning context? 
* Is there an existing pathway that people can use to teach the mix of skills and tools you need to use? 
* Is there a possibility to design courses that compliment each other—e.g. teaching a digital game design course and then a hardware one where students can prototype physical controllers for the games they made? 
* How should we grade in these courses? 
* How do we provide students a low risk but safe environment for breaking hardware/machines? 
* How do we provide sustainable models for maintaining machines/hardware? 
* How can we share tool combinations that work well together, and give a meaningful learning space without being overwhelming? 

Afterwards, the discussion ended with members of the group sharing their desired workspaces and prior experiences, the types of tools they usually teach with, and the types of assignments they give. Many in the group shared that they either preferred to teach or have taught in both formal settings (i.e. an engineering department) and informal spaces that encourage exploratory learning with Arduinos/physical computing. They also shared that informal peer learning often happens within more open spaces as well, such as a maker space or fabrication lab. 

For tool combinations, some shared that they used: [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) + [p5.js](https://p5js.org/#), [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/)/[Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/), and physical computing kits (i.e. desired components and an Arduino). Finally, some assignments they have given were: required weekly project-based assignments with documentation on a webpage or instructables, take home midterms aimed at electronics knowledge, teaching a class on working with different “paper types” and the tools needed for it, like sheet metal and vinyl cutters.

### Community Practices and Alternative Approaches to Technology 

This discussion was focused on how to bridge the widening gap between being a consumer using technology and using technology creatively. It started by naming different forms of technology outside of the commonly assumed scope, such as: toys that introduce programmatic thinking (i.e the [Code-A-Pillar](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fisher-Price-Think-Learn-Code-a-pillar/49532843)), [AI Weirdness](https://www.aiweirdness.com/), [Esolangs and alternative ways code can look](https://esoteric.codes/blog/jon-corbett), and viewing community itself as a type of organizational and building technology.

With some examples identified, the group then explored how they could decentralize approaches to how people learned about technology. They noted that instructing through different mediums (i.e learning coordinate geometry through weaving) and treating teaching itself as a technology to implement non-hierarchical structures and inviting exploration/play were vital, as well as encouraging others to question and ideate on what alternative technology could look like. Some questions that were raised were: What are expanded definitions of technology? How does technology’s current definition create hierarchies? What would technologies that aren't oppressive to our identities, bodies, and livelihoods look like? Where does code exist away from screens and syntax? 

The group ended the discussion by critiquing the current state of technology, which they feel strongly reflects the values and biases of its creators, despite some claims that it is value-neutral. They also felt that it can obscure the embedded positionality of its creators and context, which is why bringing visibility to alternative and communal-forward approaches are important.

### Education as Job Training Vs. Education as an End in Itself

Some underlying themes of this discussion were: identifying the education and skills needed for a career, what motivates students when they enter a classroom and what they are hoping to take away from it, and what would educators like to convey to their students. 

The group began by pointing out how they felt it was important to teach the “why”, or the concepts, history, and inspirations, behind a subject in tandem with its application (e.g. helping students understand what it means to learn software vs. what it means to learn design). However, some students with loans might feel pressured to feel that they need a “return on their investment” and prioritize career skills in their education. This led to the question of whether knowing a tool is enough to earn a job in and of itself, and if not, what other additional career training will students need? Should educators be equipping their students simply with the skills needed for acquiring jobs at larger companies (like Google or Apple), or do they encourage students to have agency and creativity over their own tools and paths? 

With these questions in mind, the group began to explore how to create accessible pathways to learning outside of a career context. They felt that teaching people to be able to support themselves as freelancers or entrepreneurs were important in order for students to feel confident in their ability to support themselves and empowered enough to freely move within their education. They also felt that another important skill to impart to students was how to maneuver around the obsolescence of technology by using documentation and several resources to search for answers and synthesize information as things change and disappear. Some group members also questioned if freeing education of its financial costs could remove these demands of being a “customer”. 

The discussion of different forms of support and resources students could find led to questions of whether [ChaptGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) could be a new pivotal one, like [Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and how useful are AI tools in general for novices and experts. Although AI tools could potentially be helpful for brainstorming and presenting different approaches to a problem, the group felt concerned about how to instruct students to recognize when tools like ChaptGPT are wrong, and how to encourage them to be proactive about it.

The group ended the discussion pinpointing some actions they could currently take to start addressing their concerns and working towards their desires. Some suggestions were: 



* designing exercises to examine the effectiveness of AI tools
* educating people to understand their tools well enough to be able to pinpoint issues and help design their nest generation
* design a project to be teachable and have students to design a tutorial for the class
* encouraging students to consider what they’d want from their education
* Have students question if school is necessary for learning new tools (in reference to the pre-professionalization era of web design, where most taught themselves and imbued their own creativity into their websites). 

Finally, they felt it was important to teach the value of strong ideas, persistence, resourcefulness, and working through technological processes regardless of skill level.
