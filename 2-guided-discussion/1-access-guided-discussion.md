### Introduction

At the Open Source Arts Contributor Conference in 2023, the guided discussion session on “Access” aimed to discuss the importance and role of access and accessibility in software, the web, and creative involvement. Over 30 OSACC conference attendees participated in this discussion.  

The access-guided discussion started with a 5-minute introduction, followed by 45 minutes for smaller group discussions and note-taking in 4 different subtopics. The subtopics for the access guided workshop were accessible open source software, web accessibility, data sovereignty + community access, creative access, and access and education. Some grounding questions given as a starting point for the subtopics groups included asking why accessibility is important, what stake we each have in access, what we are each doing to promote accessibility, and what “access” means to each of us. The subtopic discussion aimed to leave room for everyone to speak. The groups were encouraged to embrace awkward silences, be kind and generous, and share space. The shared document was used to take notes or as a way to contribute to participants who preferred not to speak out loud. The discussion ended with a 10-minute closing share-out with representatives from each subtopic group.

### Accessible Open Source Software

**Discussion Lead:** Qianqian Ye

[Qianqian Ye](https://qianqian-ye.com/), current p5.js project lead working on improving the accessibility of the software, led a discussion on accessible open-source software. Accessible open-source software can be hard to define. One definition shared by a group member was “access = providing an opportunity for communities who are historically excluded, to create non-western focused software, and to make translation possible.”

In the discussion, some good practices participants shared for accessible open source software were publishing a strategic plan for others to read and borrow for their own projects, sharing work transparently, and including documentation in code. Another important practice discussed is making tutorials and documentation. Some participants shared Marlin and Arduino as being good examples of this.

When discussing the topic of tutorials and documentation, participants pointed out that alt text for images should be considered. Moreover, as much documentation as possible should be in the code so that it is self-contained, and anything else is outlinked but with a description.  

To improve accessibility in projects such as source codes, documentation, and outreach efforts, solutions that were discussed fell into two categories, both revolving around the community. The first category is community building. Ideas participants shared for this category include community building in different regions, and online community events such as contests, GSoC, hackathons, gamejam, online picnics, and hardware happy hours. The second category is community sharing. This category includes ideas such as sharing how you make what you make and sharing concerns about inaccessible software. Some other possible ways that were shared on how to improve accessibility include having a video online about how to contribute to open source and having a frequent issues page. Furthermore, not only is it important for accessible open source software to contain accessible components internally, but it is also important to educate the community on why accessibility is important.

### Web Accessibility

**Discussion Lead:** Sammie Veeler

[Sammie Veller](https://miss-sammie.neocities.org/), the co-founder of an accessible online art platform New Art City, led a discussion about web accessibility. Web accessibility is oftentimes oversimplified to alt text. However, as many group participants pointed out, alt text is only one vector. Cognitive accessibility brings its own set of challenges. With this in mind, the web accessibility discussion brought forth many questions and curiosities. Participants asked, when discussing alt text, how do you write alt text for interactions or data visualizations? What are the implications for social media such as Instagram and Twitter pushing the responsibility for alt text on the end user.

Questions and curiosities were also posed for the broader topic. How do you make labor visible? How do you have documentation within the project itself, not some thing that lives on the side? When considering accessibility as a whole and its intersecting needs, how do you identify and prioritize them? And what movements can you make to achieve that goal? Moreover, access to technology itself is an important topic to consider. Who can access what kind of tech? 

There are currently some tools that have helped accessibility such as Figma plugins. Participants also shared the idea that Zoom has made physical spaces more accessible geographically. There are other tools that are debatable regarding how much they are actually helping, such as AI for captioning. 

Accessibility is often viewed in the lens of compliance, as an annoyance after the fact rather than a foundational principle. However, as Sammie Veeler, co-founder of an accessible online art platform New Art City, mentioned, accessibility can benefit everyone but it doesn’t have to in order to be valuable.

[Bobby Joe Smith III](https://www.bobbyjoesmith.com/), a Black and Lakota (Hunkpapa and Oohenumpa) graphic designer and media artist, led a discussion on data sovereignty + community access. In the discussion group about who owns the right to access, approaching open source projects as an ally, and creating open source projects, there were more questions than answers. Questions that were explored include the following: 



* How are default assumptions about who communities are & acceptance of the fast pace of open source development keeping people out who otherwise might want to participate?
* To what degree can academic institutions (or large-scale institutions as a whole) meaningfully support increased accessibility? Alternatively, are academic institutions fundamentally at odds with the goal of increasing accessibility- e.g. as highly disciplinary, siloed institutions with an incentive to preserve the status quo and standards?
* Challenge, complexity, and friction is not the end of the design challenge, but the beginning. Can you prepare yourself to sit with the trouble when you come upon a design quandary caused by our current tools or social contexts? In the face of uncertainty, how might you work across differences to craft solutions, processes, tools, and language that better reflect our needs, desires, and community?
* How can you make sure the open-source work you are creating is appropriately being utilized? Are any guidelines limiting creative use?

However, one profound statement was created; problems are the start of a design challenge, not the end of it.

### Creative Access

**Discussion Lead:** Nat Decker

[Nat Decker](https://www.instagram.com/crip_fantasy/), an access worker and artist interested in the politics, aesthetics, and narratives of queer disabled experience, led a discussion on creative access. It is important to consider access as a foundational design element to a project–part of the concept from the beginning; not an afterthought, but a forethought. Many discussion participants have observed a radical shift to rethink structures of our spaces and projects that are accessible. As artists, accessibility should not be a checklist, but made into a creative prompt. In such cases, artists are encouraged to embrace slowness. There are currently artists working with experimental accessibility and the aesthetics of access are interesting to consider. When one lacks access the most is when one needs to be most creative. One example shared was queer Korean Sign Language which includes tools for hacking/re-signing language that can be oppressive. Another example is VR haptics created for blind users at NYU.

There are also limits mentioned in the discussion of creative access. For example, there could be boundaries that artists wish to implement. Participants shared that they do not want their projects to be accessible to corporate entities, for example. There are also limitations in what artists are physically capable of doing. Although creatives should give agency to users, participants, and community members, we can’t always make tools for everything, and we need to accept that we can’t capture everyone’s lived experience.  

In discussing this topic, some related topics participants mentioned were digital survivorship, disability justice, and collective liberation.

### Access and Education 

**Discussion Lead:** Lauren Mitchell

 \
Lauren Mitchell, Director of Makerspace and a computer science teacher at an all-girls high school in NYC, led a discussion on access and education. Accessibility hurdles within education begin with hiring educators. There are gates on who can even teach. And even after hiring, what determines who are the right people to design for accessibility? Discussion participants agreed that treating accessibility as a standard practice, such as subtitles and proper tags to websites, provides broader benefits. It is important to be intentional in programming and designing at the beginning. This approach was even used in designing the OSACC Education Discussion. 

Good pedagogy agreed upon by the group is to challenge students to push their understanding. However, one problem educators face is the labor burden of creating accessible content. There were many ideas exchanged on how to funnel resources toward closing this gap. One idea shared is that educators can write it into grants and other budgets. Another consideration is possibly leveraging AI. However, AI translations have limitations. Participants also noted that there are also generational divides in basic computer skills and concepts to consider.

Discussion participants exchanged ideas on guiding principles to consider when designing teaching materials. Some ideas shared include that before even starting, empathy building from design thinking is a valuable skill to aid the process. Then, while building, presumptions and biases about what accessibility/accommodation asks are should be tested. Universal design should also be used. However, there is value in customization and domain/user-specific applications. While designing, motivation is often in thinking about the task as “designing for a loved one.” One should also design from other perspectives to add new perspectives and innovative general-purpose interactions.
