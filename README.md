# p5.js Access Report at Open Source Arts Contributors Conference (OSACC) 
This report is currently work in progress.

## i. Overview
We are thrilled to share this report documenting a convening of the Open Source Arts Contributor’s Conference (OSACC), organized by Chris Coleman, Kate Hollenbach, Qianqian Ye, Shawné Michaelain Holloway, Xin Xin, and Tsige Tafesse in Denver, Colorado on April 13-15, 2023.

This event was a three-day conversation and ‘unconference’, populated by founders, maintainers, and contributors of open-source arts-engineering tools such as p5.js, Processing, openFrameworks, Hydra, Netnet, OPENRNDR, Shaderpark, Sonic Pi, and more.

The conference was formatted with time blocks for guided discussion and working sessions. Guided discussions were designed to broaden the scope of our collective thinking on the topics of Access, Education, Sustainability, and AI/Future Thinking. Working sessions provided opportunities for people to learn from and contribute to various software projects. To help folks make connections across projects and make space for new contributors, lightning talks were presented throughout the conference by any attendees who wanted to share their work.

At the 2019 Contributors Conference, p5.js committed to only adding features to p5.js that increase access (meaning inclusion and/or accessibility). This means considering the vectors of diversity (e.g. gender, social, economic, race, ethnicity, language, disability, etc.) that can impact access/participation; and taking action to acknowledge, dismantle, and prevent barriers.

This report aims to focus p5.js’s effort in access and highlight the intersectionality and expansiveness of accessibility work in OSSTA communities. As we identify challenges and the continued effort for greater access, we hope to inspire community members to consider how access and care can be centered in their work.

We recognize that there are many more toolkits, contributors, and perspectives than those represented by this one convening. We see this as a conversation that can hopefully spark others and contribute to an ongoing dialogue.

We offer our deepest gratitude to the participants of the convening, and the many, many other contributors to these toolkits, without whom, the field of art and technology would not exist. 

## ii. Takeaways
We summarized serveral takeaways from the p5.js working groups and guided discussions. The takeaways here focus on suggestions to increase access to OSSTA.

More takeaways will be added shortly.
