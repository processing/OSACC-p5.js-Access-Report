**PARTICIPANTS**

The participants in this gathering were chosen based on various factors, such as their historical connections to the tools, unique and under-represented perspectives, valuable background experiences, industry insights, and pedagogic expertise.

Throughout this gathering and report, we utilize the term "contributor" instead of "developer" to encompass a wide array of roles involved in OSSTAs. These contributions go beyond software development and encompass activities like translation, documentation, teaching, graphic design, illustration, writing, organizing, and curating. 

With an open-call style application, OSACC hosted 70 attendees from multiple continents. As the conference was hosted in Denver, Colorado, costs such as transportation and hotel accommodation for participants were supported by National Endowment for the Arts, Community Building Award from Mozilla, the Processing Foundation, and many individual programs. We acknowledge that access and inclusion is an ever-evolving effort, hence, it is important to recognize the limitations including the reach of marketing, finances, and schedules of the diverse contributors and toolkits out there.

**PHYSICAL SPACE & FOOD ACCOMMODATIONS**

Hosted at C-Cubed Studios on the second floor of the Shwayder Art Building at the University of Denver, the building had signs posted on the walls to help attendees easily navigate the space. The space was modified to provide gender-neutral restrooms, designated quiet spaces, and a variety of chairs and tables with different heights for different working styles and types of access.

As OSACC provided food services including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, the conference was equipped with vegan, gluten-free, non-dairy options, and more to accommodate a variety. Additionally, amenities such as lip balms, lotion, and hand sanitizers were provided to assist attendees with climate adjustment.

**DIGITAL SPACE**

With a unified communication platform–Discord, participants were able to get onboard pre-conference, receive live announcements, and stay connected virtually even after the event. The platform housed various “channels,” which allow space for discussion on different interest topics, social conversations, and planning of physical meet-ups. Channels such as “introduction” and “archive” allowed participants to freely upload photos and video content to share with others and contribute to the documentation of the event.

The [opensourceart.cc](https://opensourceart.cc) website also served as a warehouse of information including scheduling, transportation details, and the conference code of conduct. Consolidating conference information on one website allowed attendees to easily access and navigate information to prepare and stay on track.

A group stretch sesion was led with stretches inspired by creative coding terms. These stretches were ideated with the use of chat.gpt.

**UNCONFERENCE STYLE CONFERENCING**

In the spirit of an “unconference” style conference, the OSACC was designed to center on the shared experience of coming together rather than the material product the conference can produce. This meant that conference organizers stayed flexible and observed the crowd's energy levels and interests to determine the conference schedule.

As the conference also had an outlined code of conduct, values of kindness and care served as grounding principles. During discussions, groups were encouraged to embrace awkward silences, be kind and generous, and share space. Additionally, participants were encouraged to contribute in the fashion they were most comfortable with– either physically sharing their thoughts or typing out their ideas on the shared document for those who preferred not to speak out loud.
