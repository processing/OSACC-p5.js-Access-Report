I was fortunate to attend the Open Source Art Contributor's Conference (OSACC) in Denver this year, where I met people behind incredible open-source art projects like Processing, p5.js, and Hydra, and some of my personal heroes like Sarah Ciston and Dorothy Santos. At a p5 working group at the conference, I saw my first p5 sketch in the community catalog and realized that just two years ago, I was creating my first p5 sketch using the random function. Now, I am sharing my open-source community library among the very people who invented p5 and processing

The fact that the library I worked on, p5.genzine, is an open-source software holds great significance for me, and it's essential that it remains free and open. The idea for this open-source and user-friendly library for creating and sharing zines online came from this feeling of urgency in open-source publishing, which came out of the history of zine-making in Taiwan. 

Nearly 50 years of martial law, imposed in Taiwan from 1949 to 1987, was a period marked by severe restrictions on freedom of speech, assembly, and press, as well as widespread government surveillance and censorship. The ruling Kuomintong (KMT) government controlled and censored all forms of media, leaving little room for alternative viewpoints or the expression of marginalized voices. It was a dark period that my parents lived through. A period where people were arrested or went missing for publishing content that displeased the government, including topics like democracy, queer culture, and civil resilience. As a result, the urgency of self-publishing and zine-making emerged as an underground movement that provided a space for people to voice their opinions, challenge the status quo, and share information outside the government's watchful eye.

I feel truly fortunate to be born in today’s Taiwan, an era in which these values are not only protected but also celebrated. As I developed this project, I was constantly reminded of the pride many Taiwanese hold in their right to free speech. This hard-won freedom has given birth to a multitude of beautifully diverse and critical cultural pieces that not only inspire us but also serve as a constant reminder of our bloody history and the precarious privilege we now possess.

The library was developed with these concepts in mind, aiming to make zine-coding more accessible. By offering an alternative self-publishing tool for marginalized voices, it draws upon zine-making's political roots as a symbol of resilience against oppression and censorship, providing an experimental platform for diverse expression. 

I came to realize the similarity between the sociopolitical landscape of open-source movements and the fight for freedom of expression at OSACC. Just like zine-making emerged as a means to challenge censorship and amplify marginalized voices, the open-source art community has also fostered a space where creativity, collaboration, and innovation can thrive outside the confines of proprietary control.

Open-source art and software embody the principles of transparency, accessibility, and inclusivity. They promote the sharing of knowledge, tools, and resources, enabling individuals from all walks of life to participate, learn, and contribute. It is through this collective effort that we build upon the foundations laid by those who came before us, just as I stand on the shoulders of people who have crafted the p5 and processing community before me.

Just as zine-making, the community acts as a support network, fostering connections and collaborations that transcend geographical boundaries. At events like OSACC, we come together to share our experiences, exchange ideas, and inspire one another. We celebrate the diversity of perspectives and learn from the hard work of individuals and projects. It is within this vibrant ecosystem that p5.genzine was born, an embodiment of the values and aspirations of the open-source movement.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the path of open-source contributions is not always easy. It requires dedication, perseverance, and a commitment to addressing the challenges that exist within this realm. From sustaining projects in the face of financial constraints to fostering greater inclusivity and diversity, each hurdle presents an opportunity for growth and improvement.

Yet, amidst these challenges, I am filled with a genuine sense of optimism. Witnessing the collaborative spirit and collective reimagining at OSACC, I am reminded of our collective ability to shape a brighter future together. By continuing to build ethical and sustainable technological approaches, creating tools and software that reflect our values, we can foster a more inclusive and impactful creative landscape. As artists, designers, writers, educators, and activists, we hold the power to transcend boundaries, amplify marginalized voices, and drive positive change.

While OSACC happened during a turbulent period marked by a global pandemic, economic uncertainties, and the ever-looming presence of AI, I am genuinely optimistic about our collective ability to build a brighter future together.
