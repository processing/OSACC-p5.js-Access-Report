## OSACC Reflection
Raphaël de Courville

_“If you are able to take 15 minutes to provide a brief summary of what the Processing Foundation accomplished or got out of OSACC that would be EXTREMELY helpful. You were one of the biggest teams at the conference so how did PF use their time/the provided work sessions? A short paragraph or even just a bullet point list of what your team did (what other meetings, work, or networking did you do?), and any top of mind reflections on the value of the conference would be really helpful to COSA for current reporting and future grant writing purposes.” - Greg J. Smith_

The time and resources provided by OSACC facilitated targeted work sessions, cross-pollination of ideas, and networking, all of which contributed to the future developments of the Processing Foundation's software projects and the building of our community.


### Processing Community Catalog Reading

We were delighted to host a unique Reading Party for the newly launched Processing Community Catalog. This event allowed us to share an exclusive preview of our art+tech book, an almost 1000-page testament to our community's strength and diversity that celebrates two decades of achievements and creativity. Notable contributors Casey Reas, Dorothy R. Santos, Lauren Lee McCarthy, and Qianqian Ye, took turns reading selected excerpts. Inviting a moment of spontaneity, we also opened the floor for audience members who felt inspired to share a page from our book. This event truly reflected the spirit of our global community and remains a very special highlight of our time at OSACC.


### Expanding Processing Examples

The Processing Foundation took a first step at OSACC towards improving the examples page on the Processing.org website. The work group focused on three main areas: modernizing examples, enhancing the user journey, and promoting community participation. In terms of outcomes, a roadmap was developed for content updates, the page’s structure was scrutinized for possible improvements, and creative strategies were formulated to encourage wider community involvement with the examples section.


### P5 Community and Access Statements

We were able to gather a group of contributors to discuss and shape the future iteration of the p5 Community and Access Statements. These statements are pivotal to the building of our community and vision, as well as the ethos in which we desire to shape our software project, p5. Access has been a central focus to the p5.js project, and through this space we were able to gather a group of BIPOC, queer, trans, disabled, new media artists, activists, organizers, educators, and other professionals to discuss our Community and Access Statements.


### Getting together

OSACC provided a rare and precious opportunity for the globally dispersed Processing Foundation team to come together in a single location, allowing many of us to meet face-to-face for the very first time. The chance to connect personally and professionally in the same space, exchanging ideas and experiences, added an invaluable dimension to our work in ways that virtual communication simply couldn't capture, amplifying our dedication to the mission of the Foundation. Meeting teams from other projects was also particularly productive, sparking some collaborations. Dave Pagurek’s implementation of Shaderpark in p5.js stands out as a wonderful example of this cross-pollination effect.
